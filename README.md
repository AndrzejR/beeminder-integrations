# beeminder-integrations

Updates Beeminder goals with data from different sources, starting with Toggl (based on TogglToBeeminder).

Written in Python 3. Maybe it works with Python 2, but probably not.

Learning Python, AWS, REST APIs etc., all the while doing something personally really useful.

Current deployment instructions in deploy.txt.
